In this third module we will explore the opportunities to use data in the design process, from data-enabled design to product analytics. We will touch on designer's responsibilities when designing connected products.

During the lecture 5 we will have a closer look at data. We will discuss its properties, visualisation and analytics.



During the sandpit, you will demo live data with your prototype and present your data analysis.
