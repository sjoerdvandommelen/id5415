introduction: In this module, the self-study material focuses on sensors and the data they generate in the form of time-series. We will explore the most common sensors with their challenges and opportunities. We will introduce the concept of events as data point inputs are ingested by the system and trigger actions. Finally, we will distinguish between different options of data processing.
