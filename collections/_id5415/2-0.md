we will get an overview of the network terminology, topologies and qualities to consider during the design process. Then, we will explore different local network technologies such as Bluetooth and serial.

During the lecture 3 we will look at web technologies connecting edge and cloud computing. We will explore the protocol HTTP and MQTT to highlight their differences and applications.


During the sandpit, you will present the technology map of your connected product and demo your working prototype.
