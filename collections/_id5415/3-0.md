introduction: In the third module, you will further expand the complexity of your connected lighting system by adding sensing to the prototype, through light,  temperature, and humidity sensors. This will make its behaviour contextual!
explain: Explain the concepts of sensors, time series, events and data processing.
make: Collect data from sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi and trigger events.
analyse: Analyse time series data generated from sensors.
evaluate: Evaluate the quality of time series data and motivate alternative sensing options
