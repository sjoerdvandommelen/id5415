introduction: In this module, the self-study material focus on the fundamentals of programming. While this course is not a programming course, we will explore the necessary basics to get started such as state and code management. We will motivate the choice of Python for this course, and introduce a few specifics to Python. Finally, we will introduce the concept of version control systems and code library, necessary step to use code from others and collaborate.

# Python

In the first assignment we installed Python to run the library that interact with the light bulb.

## Why do we use Python?

Because it was [invented by the Dutch Guido van Rossum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0Aq44Pze-w). No, well yes it is a Dutch design but not the main reason we use it in this course! Its relevance comes from a global community across disciplines (from mathematics to data science, artificial intelligence and automation) and its acknowledge ease to get started in contrast with other programming languages.

## What is Python?

## Why Python for this course

This Why and What help us understand the relevance of Python in this course. To prototype a connected product,

- we need a programming language that we can use for a wide variety of tasks from controlling a light bulb to visualising sensor data and fetching the next weather forecast from a web service;
- we need to get quickly up to speed and focus on the prototyping and testing, rather than the coding itself.

# Code Management

# Version Control System

- Git

## How what about GitHub?
